Startpage
========

A simple startpage to meet my needs.

![alt tag](Home.png "Startpage preview")

**Live Demo:** [Demo](http://ramenmaestro.github.io/startpage/)

This repository contains a custom startpage made using HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. I'm not a web developer, this was a simple project I worked on to refresh my basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

Possible future updates:
* Fix scaling issue
* Include search-bar
* Light theme
* Random sidebar image cycle

Don't hesitate to fork and modify to your liking.
