========

A simple startpage to meet my needs.

**Live Demo:** [Demo](https://kstr-0.github.io/startpage/)

This repository contains a custom startpage made using HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. I'm not a web developer, this was a simple project I worked on to refresh my basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
